What does this app do?
The main idea is to create a wishlist of desriable spots of your own, which you can come back later to visit them all.

This app features Mapbox Map API, Geocoding API to create a LBS_app.

Users can either search the place name on map and then add the place to a wishlist, or can add the place directly in the wishlist.

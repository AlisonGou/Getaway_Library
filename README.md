# Getaway_Library

## What does this app do?

The main idea is to create a wishlist of desriable spots of your own, which you can come back later to visit them all.

This app features Mapbox Map API, Geocoding API to create a LBS_app.

Users can either search the place name on map and then add the place to a wishlist, or can add the place directly in the wishlist.

4. If I am interested in adding a dreamy place directly into my wishlist, then I could click on the "add bookmark", for example,
I would like to visit "重庆（chongqing）" in the future, then I added it to my list:
